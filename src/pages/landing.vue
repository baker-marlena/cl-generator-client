    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>
      This is a site for storing and browsing cover letter snippets to make writing cover letters a little less tedius. Each snippet can be tagged with as many tags as you need to find it easily later. This way you have a collection of building blocks that you wrote to make cover letters that are uniquely yours and tailored for the job at hand.

      Eventually, I'd like to add sections for storing relevant stories and back-pocket interview answers to help job seakers prepare for the interview process, but I'm not sure when that will become a reality.
